Asynchronous Messaging Protocol for Java

amp4j is a library for making AMP clients and servers based on
Glyph's "amphacks" code, with a few additional features and bugfixes.

Also included is a basic Reactor-style asynchronous networking
implementation, which may be used for convenience instead of the
traditional Java networking APIs.
